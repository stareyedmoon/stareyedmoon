# Helo!!
I'm stareyedmoon, also known as Stella Nova! This may be super suprising, but I like to write code every now and then.

I mainly use Rust and Python (though I'm not very good at Rust yet), but I also have some experience in C++ and Lua.

I want to write more stuff here, but I don't know what yet, so I'll do that later.
